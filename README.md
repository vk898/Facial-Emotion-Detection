# Facial-Emotion-Detection
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is the technology that analyses facial expressions from both 
static images and videos in order to reveal information on one’s emotional state.  Basically emotions can be classified into 7 classes —
happy, sad, fear, disgust, angry, neutral and surprise. Furthermore, in videos, changes in those 
positions are also analyzed, in order to identify contractions in a group of facial muscles.
Facial expressions can be classified to basic emotions (e.g. anger, 
disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) or compound emotions (e.g. happily sad, happily 
surprised, happily disgusted, sadly fearful, sadly angry, sadly, surprised).
